================================

cloudCS Allows multiple users to use 
Circuitscape (http://www.circuitscape.org/) on a cloud hosted 
infrastructure. It provides a browser based interface for Circuitscape, 
both on the desktop (standalone mode) and the cloud (multiuser mode).

Circuitscape is a free, open-source program which borrows algorithms
from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of movement, gene
flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal populations
in heterogeneous landscapes.
